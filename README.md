# 🛍️ ShoPperZ – Responsive E-Commerce Website

ShoPperZ is a modern, fully responsive e-commerce front-end website built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. It replicates the functionality and aesthetics of professional online retail platforms, delivering a smooth, engaging, and device-friendly user experience.

The project features a clean and dynamic UI design, including a navigation bar with hover effects, a mobile-friendly hamburger menu, a CSS-powered sliding image banner, and a grid-based product catalog. Each product card showcases an image, title, pricing, and additional info, with interactive hover animations and responsive layouts optimized via **media queries**.

JavaScript is used for toggling the menu on smaller screens, ensuring easy navigation on all devices. The layout adapts seamlessly to various resolutions, maintaining design integrity across desktops, tablets, and mobiles. The use of **Ionicons** adds a polished touch to both navigation and social media sections.
